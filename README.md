This website is created using Vue 3 and Firebase as a backend.

It allows us to log into an account and create different music playlists so every user can create their own playlist.

On the home page are displayed all the playlists by different users
Each playlist has their own thumbnail, title, who it's by and how many songs they have inside that playlist
